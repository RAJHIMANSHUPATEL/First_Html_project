                    <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
                <p>Just like with any other activity, the worldof coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of  these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Programmers find innovative ways to recreatethese languages for different purposes. Thus, some static do’s and don’ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability.</p>

                    <h2>PREREQUISITS</h2>
                    <p>This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even  if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and architecture.</p>
                    <p>Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good coding practices.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h2>COMMENTING</h2>
                            <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge  transfer.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h2>
                            <p>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>DEPLOYMENT</h2>
                            <p>The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable.</p>
